From the Atlantic coast of North Carolina, south to Florida, west across the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana, and along the coastlines of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, the coastal area in the Southeast covers more than **26,000 miles** of tidal shoreline and nearshore habitats, and more than **86 million acres** of diverse coastal habitat and natural resources. This area accounts for the largest, most diverse and most productive coastal area in the country.

However, our southeastern coasts need our attention. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Louisiana’s coastline has been losing wetlands at a rate of 16.6 square miles a year for the past 25 years, **equal to the loss of a football field of wetlands every hour**. In addition,the U.S. Global Change Research Program predicts sea level rise and the likely increase in hurricane intensity and associated storm surge will be among the most serious consequences of climate change in the Southeast, directly impacting our coasts.

## Threats to the Health of our Coast

### Habitat Loss Caused by Human Development

Human development of our coasts represents the largest threat to the continued health coastal resources in the Southeast Region. In 2010, over half of the human population in the southeastern United States lived within 50 miles of the coast, impacting coastal wetlands and beaches through development, disturbance, and degradation of habitat.

The Gulf of Mexico and southern Atlantic coasts continue to represent **the fastest growing coastal region in the nation**, with a 58% increase in population between 1980 and 2003. The Southeast has increasingly become a leading destination for retirees and job-seekers. Between 1995 and 2000, the Census Bureau reported that the highest levels of migration were to states in the Southeast and the Gulf of Mexico region, particularly Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina.

Southeastern coastal upland habitats are also largely in decline. A considerable number of federally threatened, endangered, and at-risk species are associated with these ecosystems, as well as state listed species. To-date the southeast has seen:

 - A 99% loss of longleaf pine habitat,
 - A 98% loss of pine rockland habitat,
 - A 60-80% loss of tropical hardwood hammocks, and
 - 70-84% loss of coastal scrub and sandhills.

### Sea Level Rise

The southeastern coastline is experiencing large impacts from documented sea level rise. Along the mid to south Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the sea level has risen five to six inches more than the global average over the past 100 years.

Coastal wetland ecosystems are especially vulnerable, and the effects are particularly apparent in North Carolina, Louisiana and the Florida Everglades. Since the 1970’s, the Southeast Region has experienced a loss of over 55% of coastal wetlands. Despite the national trend of no-net-loss of wetlands in the early 2000’s, this region continues to show wetland loss, although the rate of loss is decreasing.

### Erosion
Some of the most economically important vulnerable areas are recreational resorts on the coastal barriers of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, where many ocean shores are currently eroding at a rate of **1-4 feet per year**.

This causes tremendous pressure to renourish beaches with sand or provide hard armoring structures to the beachfronts with direct consequences to natural systems and processes.

## The Opportunity

Habitat conservation plays a key role in sustaining healthy ecosystems for people, as well as maintaining and increasing wildlife populations.

Enhancing or restoring lost habitat and protecting existing habitat from human disturbances, non-native species and predators are the high priorities for coastal conservation in the southeastern United States.

## Our Services

The Southeast Region Coastal Program supports voluntary, proactive and cooperative projects in these areas, focusing efforts to restore and protect habitat for federal trust species.

We provide technical expertise and financial assistance to:

 - Private landowners and citizens;
 - Native American tribes;
 - Non-profit organizations;
 - Municipal and local governments;
 - Business and industry.

## Types of Projects
Our projects are as diverse as the habitats that we restore and protect. Some activities include:

 - Coastal wetland restoration;
 - Coastal upland restoration (maritime forest, longleaf pine, grasslands);
 - Dune restoration;
 - Invasive species control;
 - Blue carbon;
 - Living shoreline construction (such as oyster reefs);
 - Coastal river/aquatic instream;
 - Nearshore habitat restoration (coral reefs, seagrass);
 - Land protection;
 - Partnerships with public and private lands.

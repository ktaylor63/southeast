## Southeast region bald eagle monitoring guidelines

The Southeast Region of the Service issued [Bald eagle monitoring guidelines](/pdf/bald-eagle-monitoring-guidelines-2007.pdf) in 2007 for projects located in Florida only that were previously issued a Biological Opinion under Section 7 or Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act and refers to these 2007 monitoring guidelines as a biological opinion and/or permit condition.  Many existing Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission bald eagle permits also refer to these guidelines.

## Southeast region technical assistance

If you need assistance determining whether or not a federal Eagle Act permit is recommended for a project, check out [the eagle permit technical assistance page](/our-services/eagle-technical-assistance).  This site is a self-guided key that allows you to enter in project specific information that will help you determine if it is advisable to obtain a federal permit for your activities that may disturb eagles.  Please be advised that federal permits are always required under 50 CFR 22.27 for any removal of a bald eagle or golden eagle nest.  This includes any nest used by an eagle regardless of the species that originally built the nest or a nest built by an eagle but used by another migratory bird species.

The Bears Bluff National Fish Hatchery serves as a part of the  Warmwater Fisheries and Aquatic Conservation Program in  the South Atlantic-Gulf Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The coastal location of the 31-acre facility along the banks of the North Edisto River in South Carolina provides an ideal site to investigate culture techniques for a wide variety of freshwater, saltwater and anadromous (fish that migrate from saltwater to fresh) aquatic species.

## Programs

Bears Bluff’s programs focus on fishery conservation efforts with Atlantic sturgeon, American shad, red drum, and imperiled freshwater mussels, as well as habitat improvement projects related to both saltmarsh and freshwater ecosystems.

## Goals

- Restore and manage interjurisdictional coastal and riverine fishes, such as the American shad, anadromous sturgeon, and red drum.
- Aid recovery of species listed under the Endangered Species Act, such as the Atlantic sturgeon and American chaffseed, and candidate species such as the Carolina gopher frog.
- Pioneer and develop culture techniques for both freshwater and saltwater species.
- Develop hatchery product evaluation techniques.
- Enhance and restore fish habitat in both coastal and freshwater systems.

## Species viewing availability

- American shad: Most work is performed in the field, but may be viewed at the hatchery as eggs or fry between March and May.
- Atlantic sturgeon: Can be observed year round. Possible eggs and newly hatched fry available for viewing in August and September.
- Red drum: Held September to November. Fry are grown out in production ponds and then stocked in surrounding areas. Production ponds may be viewed but the fish are not available for viewing.
- Carolina gopher frog: Eggs are collected, hatched, and tadpoles are available for viewing  between February and July.
- Savannah lilliput: May be seen on station between May and August.
- Eastern oyster: Oyster shell collection station is open year round. Reef builds typically occur between May and September

The field station was established in 1972. We strive for ecosystem sustainability through preservation, conservation, enhancement, and restoration of habitats essential for the long-term viability of the fish, wildlife, and plants in Louisiana. The field office emphasizes an ecosystem approach incorporating Strategic Habitat Conservation to address and prioritize habitat issues through partnerships with other federal and state agencies, conservation organizations, private landowners, and citizens to achieve the greatest possible benefits to fish and wildlife.

## Relocation

## Louisiana Endangered Species Act (ESA) project review and guidance for other federal trust resources

[The IPaC application](https://ecos.fws.gov/ipac/) is designed to streamline the review of projects for potential effects to federally listed threatened and endangered species (T&amp;E) and their critical habitat (CH).

### Emergency Consultations

Occasionally, federal agencies must respond to emergency situations where human life and property are in danger. Examples include oil spills, wildland fire and hurricanes. The Endangered Species Act and its implementing regulations recognize the need to respond immediately to emergencies and provide special procedures that allow federal agencies the latitude to complete their emergency responses in order to secure human life and property without delay, while still providing them with protections that normal compliance under the ESA would have afforded them.

### The Louisiana Sea Turtle Stranding Hotline is Changing

The Louisiana Sea Turtle Stranding and Salvage Network’s toll-free hotline is changing on October 1, 2019.  The new toll-free number to report a live or dead stranded sea turtle in Louisiana is 1-844-SEA-TRTL (1-844-732-8785), select option 4 to report a sea turtle, and then option 4 for Louisiana.  The public plays an important role in sea turtle conservation by reporting injured, sick, and dead sea turtles to the stranding hotline.  All sea turtles washed ashore in Louisiana should now be reported by calling 1-844-SEA-TRTL (1-844-732-8785). If your call is not answered immediately, please leave a detailed message with your name, phone number, location (GPS coordinates, address, or descriptive location), condition (alive or dead), and size of the turtle, and a stranding coordinator will return your call as soon as possible. If possible please take photos of the turtle and we will work with you to receive the photos.  It may not be possible for all dead turtles to be retrieved or buried. Your photos and the location of the turtle help scientists accurately document and count each stranded turtle. Thank you for your assistance.

## Suggested Streamlined Coordination for Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Drilling and Production in Louisiana Shale Plays

[This document](/pdf/guidelines/suggested-streamlined-coordination-oil-and-gas-exploration-drilling-production.pdf) was prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (Service) Louisiana Ecological Services Office (LESO) and partners to protect and conserve important public resources such as wildlife and plants, and their habitats (including waterbodies) within areas of Louisiana with a high potential for new or continued oil and natural gas drilling and production.

## Five Year Strategic Plan

Our Five-Year Strategic Plan details the strategies needed to achieve our goals. An annual review of each program's accomplishments will be completed under the direction of the project leader with each program coordinator. In that review, field office priority areas, partnership opportunities, program focus, personnel development opportunities will be evaluated.

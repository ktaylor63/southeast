Wolf Creek National Fish Hatchery was constructed in 1975, making it one of the newest in the federal hatchery system. With an annual budget of $1,200,000, this station produces approximately 1 million brown, brook, cutthroat and rainbow trout weighing 275,000 pounds every year. Fish are [stocked into over 100 different public fishing waters](/pdf/map/wolf-creek-stocking-map.pdf) in cooperation with the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. The majority of the fish are stocked in waters managed by the federal government. No private waters are stocked.

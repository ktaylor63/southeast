    summary: "Thirty-five years ago, wildlife scientists feared that the wood stork, a large wading bird of Southeast swamps, would be extinct by 2000 unless the species made a remarkable recovery. The lanky, bald-headed bird, North America’s only breeding stork species, was put on the federal Endangered Species List. State and federal wildlife managers in Georgia and elsewhere then undertook intense conservation efforts to prevent the bird from passing into oblivion. Those efforts paid off. The wood stork was upgraded in 2014 from endangered to threatened, an indication that it no longer faces extinction — another great success story of the Endangered Species Act."

Weirs help us to establish those baselines and then detect changes in populations over time.

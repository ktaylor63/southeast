The refuge was designated to protect habitatfor what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificiallight, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually."

Prior to establishing the refuge, area wetlands were threatened by urban expansion from the city of New Orleans. The refuge is comprisedof over 18,000 acres of offshore grass beds, marshes, hardwood hammocks and pine ridges. With a variety of habitat on the refuge, shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical songbird migrants and a host of year-round resident waterfowl can be found here. Deer,rabbit, mink, otter, raccoon, muskrat, and nutria all make their home here, and the marshes provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for a number of fresh and saltwater species."

Peak numbers in January and February can exceed 200,000. Wood ducks are year-round residents and annually raise approximately 2,500 young in natural cavities and nest boxes. Over 225 bird specieshave been observed on the refuge and recorded by visiting ornithologists. Other wildlife to look for are beavers, otters, raccoons, wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, bobcat and the occasional armadillo."

In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were designated as National Wilderness. This barrier island refuge is located off the coast of McIntosh County,Georgia, about 50 miles south of the port city of Savannah. Blackbeard Island is accessible only by boat, and transportation to the refuge is not provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Visitors may use their own boats to reach the refuge or arrangementscan be made through local boat captains and charter services. A public boat ramp on Harris Neck NWR (Barbour River Landing) may be used as a launching site for trips to the island.<br><br>The refuge offers visitors a variety of wildlife-dependent recreational activities year-round. Wildlife observation, especially birdwatching, is excellent throughout the year. In winter months, concentrations of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds utilizethe marshlands and beaches, while songbirds abound in the wooded areas in the spring and fall. The existing trails and roads provide hikers with scenic paths ideal for nature study. Saltwater creeks that pass through the refuge marshes are open to fishingthe entire year. Presently, two archery hunts for deer are scheduled on the island in the fall and winter (click here for hunting information).",

        "narrative": "TheCaloosahatchee National Wildlife Refuge, administered as a satellite refuge of J.N. \"Ding\" Darling NWR, is located in Lee County on the Caloosahatchee River within the city of Fort Myers. The refuge was established by President Woodrow Wilson on July1, 1920, through Executive Order 3299 as a \"... preserve and breeding ground for native birds\". Originally, the Caloosahatchee refuge consisted of several mangrove islands. However, shoreline development, dredging of the river, and construction of theI-75 bridge has changed the physical arrangement and appearance of these islands. Today, the refuge still remains approximately 40 acres of mangrove shorelines and upland island habitats. The refuge is located adjacent to the Florida Power and Light Company'sOrange River Power Plant and the Orange River's outflow. The warm water outflow from the power plant is a major wintering area for the endangered West Indian manatee."

Most of the Refuge's approximately 25,000 acres are lowland hardwood forests subject to backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers.<br><br>White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge. Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979,the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat. Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation. In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a GloballyImportant Bird Area. Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site): a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey WillsWildlife Management Area. Together, these areas provide a haven for wildlife and preserve representative samples of the unique habitats originally found in the Lower Mississippi River Ecosystem."

The Refuge was established in 1964 on lands acquired by the Corp of Engineers in conjunction with the Coffeeville Lock and Dam project. The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs,and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.<br><br>The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers canexceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities. Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. Duringthe summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver."

Almost all of this forested land is flooded annually during the winter and spring by backwater flooding.<br><br>Up to 10,000 migratory waterfowl winter on the refuge, and 34 species of shorebirds have been recorded during the spring and fall migration. Peregrine falcons, least terns, black terns, bald and golden eagles, and wood storks have been observed. Due tointensive management, the refuge is critically important as a sanctuary for waterfowl and neotropical migratory birds. For this reason, the refuge is closed to public access except for an observation tower at the north end of the ponds."

The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou D'Arbonne, a stream in the Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System, and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs and oxbow lakes. Cypress swamps, bottomland hardwoodand upland forests complete the landscape that is habitat for a diverse group of plants and animals.

D'Arbonne is one of five refuges managedin the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.<br><br>In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin. High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetlandforests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide rechargeareas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas)."

This island refuge was once the site of the former United States Army Fort Dade MilitaryReservation, and abundant reminders of this unique military past can be found scattered throughout the island today. Silent gun batteries testify to a time when mighty battleships reigned supreme on the world's oceans, and a brick carriage road meandersacross the island recalling the days when mules and horses carried military personnel and their dependents on sunny picnics to the beaches. Today, gulls, least terns and other birds perch on the now silent batteries, while Gopher Tortoises, box turtlesand an occasional tourist traverse the old carriage roads. Egmont key, an island that once quaked under the sound of massive coastal cannon fire, now resides quietly amid the sounds of wildlife as, once more, nature has taken over this little slice ofFlorida paradise."

The entire basin encompasses more than 350,000 acres, of which the Refuge comprises just less than 12,000 acres.<br><br>Part of the historical values of the ACE Basin were also protected. The refuge office, a former rice plantation house built in 1828, is one of only three antebellum mansions that survived the civil war in the ACE Basin area. Former owners ensured it wouldbe preserved by placing it on the National Register of Historical Places. Undeveloped and unpolluted, the habitat remains diverse and extremely productive."

Historically, periodic flooding of the \"bottoms\"during winter and spring provided excellent wintering waterfowl habitat. These wetlands, in combination with the pine and upland hardwood forest on the higher ridges, support a wide diversity of native plants and animals."

Horizontal sections of the cave are known to be morethan 15 miles long and vertical drops of 450 feet are found within. Spectacular features including unrivaled formations, important paleological and archaeological finds, and a diverse cave fauna have contributed to Fern Cave as being described as themost spectacular cave in the U.S. and has fame both nationally and internationally."

The refuge is located in the core of occupied panther territory, and protection of this importantarea was needed to ensure that not only panthers and their habitat were protected, but also important wildlife corridors that connected adjacent private and public lands. In 1996, the refuge was expanded to 26,400 acres with the addition of more Collierfamily land through the Arizona-Florida Land Exchange Act of 1988. Today, in addition to the 5-11 Florida panthers that den, hunt and roam the refuge each month, numerous other wildlife also call the refuge home, including black bears, bobcats, white-taileddeer, Big Cypress fox squirrels, alligators and wood storks."

Since its designation as a wildlife refuge in 1962, Harris Neckhas served as a premier nesting, foraging, and wintering habitat for many species of wildlife. Signature species include wood storks, which nest in a large colony on Woody Pond, and the colorful and uncommon painted bunting, which favors nesting habitatin the refuge's maritime scrub areas.",

Today, through the efforts of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, the 35,000 acre wildlife refuge once againhosts loblolly pines on the ridges with hardwoods found along creek bottoms and in scattered upland coves. Clear streams and beaver ponds provide ideal wetlands for migrating waterfowl. Wildlife populations have been restored, and Piedmont National WildlifeRefuge now serves as a model forest ecosystem for the management of wildlife.",

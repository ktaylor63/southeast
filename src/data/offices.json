          "Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge stretches across 20.5 miles between Melbourne Beach and Wabasso Beach along Florida's east coast. The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually."

In the late 1800's and early 1900's excessive drainage activities occurred in the Everglades to pave the way for agriculture and development to meet the ever-increasing water needs of agriculture and population expansion.  To the northwest of the refuge is the Everglades Agriculture Area which includes sugar cane farms, winter vegetables, sod farms, and cattle ranches. The land east of the refuge is predominately urban with the exception of the agricultural lands of the East Coast Buffer area. To the south and southwest of the refuge lie Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3, and Everglades National Park the only remaining portions of the Everglades fresh water marsh."

With a variety of habitat on the refuge, shorebirds, wading birds, neotropical songbird migrants and a host of year-round resident waterfowl can be found here.  Deer, rabbit, mink, otter, raccoon, muskrat, and nutria all make their home here, and the marshes provide critical spawning and nursery habitat for a number of fresh and saltwater species."

Big Lake was important in the recovery of the bald eagle from its endangered status. Due to the fact that Big Lake NWR is an oasis of bottomland hardwood in an agriculturally developed area, 6,400 acres are designated as a National Natural Landmark and 2,100 acres of the Natural Landmark are included in the Wilderness Preservation System.<br><br>The refuge annually winters several species of waterfowl. Peak numbers in January and February can exceed 200,000. Wood ducks are year-round residents and annually raise approximately 2,500 young in natural cavities and nest boxes. Over 225 bird species have been observed on the refuge and recorded by visiting ornithologists. Other wildlife to look for are beavers, otters, raccoons, wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, bobcat and the occasional armadillo."

The refuge's 5,618 acres include maritime forest, salt marsh, freshwater marsh, and beach habitat. In 1975, three thousand acres of the refuge were designated as National Wilderness. This barrier island refuge is located off the coast of McIntosh County, Georgia, about 50 miles south of the port city of Savannah. Blackbeard Island is accessible only by boat, and transportation to the refuge is not provided by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Visitors may use their own boats to reach the refuge or arrangements can be made through local boat captains and charter services. A public boat ramp on Harris Neck NWR (Barbour River Landing) may be used as a launching site for trips to the island.<br><br>The refuge offers visitors a variety of wildlife-dependent recreational activities year-round. Wildlife observation, especially birdwatching, is excellent throughout the year. In winter months, concentrations of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds utilize the marshlands and beaches, while songbirds abound in the wooded areas in the spring and fall. The existing trails and roads provide hikers with scenic paths ideal for nature study. Saltwater creeks that pass through the refuge marshes are open to fishing the entire year. Presently, two archery hunts for deer are scheduled on the island in the fall and winter (click here for hunting information).",

President Theodore Roosevelt heard about the destruction of birds and their eggs on Chandeleur and Breton Islands and soon afterward created Breton Island Reservation to serve as a refuge and breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Roosevelt visited the islands in June of 1915, and this is the only refuge Roosevelt ever visited. The name was changed to Breton NWR on October 4, 1938.<br><br>Historically, Breton NWR has been the site of a Lighthouse Station (destroyed by Hurricane Katrina), a quarantine station, a small fishing village and even an oil production facility.  Currently the only infrastructure remaining on Breton NWR is a remnant of the oil production facility on Breton Island. Many anglers and birdwatchers have visited the island to enjoy its bounty, and the beauty of Breton and its wildlife has even been captured in artworks by the noted Gulf Coast artist Walter Inglis Anderson, who visited the islands on solo trips from Mississippi."

Originally, the Caloosahatchee refuge consisted of several mangrove islands. However, shoreline development, dredging of the river, and construction of the I-75 bridge has changed the physical arrangement and appearance of these islands. Today, the refuge still remains approximately 40 acres of mangrove shorelines and upland island habitats. The refuge is located adjacent to the Florida Power and Light Company's Orange River Power Plant and the Orange River's outflow.

          "Catahoula NWR was established in 1958 as a wintering area for migratory waterfowl.  Most of the Refuge's approximately 25,000 acres are lowland hardwood forests subject to backwater flooding from the Ouachita, Black, and Red Rivers.<br><br>White-tailed deer, small game mammals, songbirds, raptors, waterbirds, reptiles, and amphibians are commonly seen throughout the refuge. Waterfowl are abundant during the winter. Peak waterfowl populations of 75,000 ducks have been recorded. In 1979, the Duck Lake Impoundment was created to provide 1200 acres of waterfowl habitat. Management of the impoundment is to manipulate water levels to promote the growth of aquatic and moist soil vegetation. In 2001, Catahoula NWR was designated a Globally Important Bird Area. Catahoula Lake is recognized as a Wetlands of International Importance (RAMSAR site): a historic concentration area for shorebirds, waterbirds, and migrating/wintering waterfowl. Catahoula NWR also borders a portion of the Dewey Wills Wildlife Management Area. Together, these areas provide a haven for wildlife and preserve representative samples of the unique habitats originally found in the Lower Mississippi River Ecosystem."

The Refuge was established in 1964 on lands acquired by the Corp of Engineers in conjunction with the Coffeeville Lock and Dam project. The 4,218 acre refuge encompasses approximately 1,802 acres of lakes, sloughs, and creeks, 2,265 acres of bottomland hardwoods, and 151 acres of croplands and moist soil units.<br><br>The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide wood duck brood habitat and serve as a protected wintering area for waterfowl. Up to 200 broods of wood ducks are produced anually in the refuge's artificial nest boxes, and wintering waterfowl numbers can exceed 10,000. In addition, numerous neotropical migrant and wading birds benefit from management activities. Following a successful bald eagle hacking program in the early 1990's the refuge has played host to a nesting pair of eagles each winter. During the summer months wood storks can be found resting and feeding in the back-water sloughs and moist soil units. Resident wildlife includes white-tailed deer, gray squirrels, turkey, raccoons, opossum, American alligator, and beaver."

It is the only National Wildlife Refuge in the state of Kentucky and is comprised of one of the largest remaining bottomland hardwood forests in the region.<br><br>Bottomland hardwood forests are one of the most biologically productive ecosystems on land, and the rich moist soils from seasonal flooding nourish an explosion of wildlife diversity. Freshwater mussels, amphibians, fish, and mammals are all found in abundance here, and migratory songbirds and waterfowl take advantage of this rich habitat on their long flights from nesting to wintering grounds. This diversity and abundance of wildlife provides ample hunting, fishing, and other recreational opportunities. Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge protects, manages, and enhances this ecosystem and healthy and viable populations of wildlife found here through habitat and wildlife management, environmental education, and cooperative partnerships with conservation agencies and landowners."

          "Coldwater River National Wildlife Refuge is located in northwest Mississippi, 4 1/2 miles south of the town of Crowder.  Established in 2000,  this refuge consists of 2,374 acres.  At the center of the refuge are 24 retired catfish ponds, ranging in size from 12 to 21 acres and totaling 497 acres.  These ponds are intensively managed for migrating waterfowl, shorebirds, and wading birds.  A majority of the refuge has been reforested in native bottomland hardwood species.  Almost all of this forested land is flooded annually during the winter and spring by backwater flooding.<br><br>Up to 10,000 migratory waterfowl winter on the refuge, and 34 species of shorebirds have been recorded during the spring and fall migration.  Peregrine falcons, least terns, black terns, bald and golden eagles, and wood storks have  been observed.  Due to intensive management, the refuge is critically important as a sanctuary for waterfowl and neotropical migratory birds.  For this  reason, the refuge is closed to public access except for an observation tower at the north end of the ponds."

This unique refuge preserves the last unspoiled and undeveloped spring habitat in Kings Bay, which forms the headwaters of the Crystal River.  The refuge preserves the most important aquifer fed spring havens in Kings Bay (King Spring and Three Sisters Springs), which provide critical habitat for the manatee populations that migrate here each winter. In addition to the establishment of Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge, manatees are also protected in Kings Bay by seven federal manatee sanctuaries (November-March), and the recent designation (2012) of the entire Kings Bay area as the Kings Bay Manatee Refuge (or Kings Bay Manatee Protection Area). All three (the refuge, sanctuaries and protection area) are managed by th U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help protect nearly 600 manatees in Kings Bay each winter."

          "Operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, this National Fish Hatchery (NFH) is one of many serving a vital role in the management of our country’s fishery resources. Dale Hollow NFH was established to mitigate for fishery resources which were lost due to the construction of federal water development projects in the Southeast. This is accomplished by stocking rainbow, brown, lake, and brook trout in waters impacted by federal dams. Stocking trout in public waters supports a significant recreational fishery which generates a substantial amount of economic activity for local and regional economies. This facility is also involved in the conservation of imperiled, freshwater, non-game fishes, and mussels."

It was established in 1975 to protect bottomland hardwoods and provide wintering habitat for migratory waterfowl. Additionally the refuge provides habitat for alligators, bald eagles, the little known Rafinesque's big-eared bat and the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. The refuge is bisected by 13 miles of Bayou D'Arbonne, a stream in the Louisiana Natural and Scenic Rivers System, and is crisscrossed by numerous creeks, sloughs and oxbow lakes. Cypress swamps, bottomland hardwood and upland forests complete the landscape that is habitat for a diverse group of plants and animals. D'Arbonne NWR also has the national record mayhaw tree, a wetland species with fruit that makes delicious jelly. D'Arbonne is one of five refuges managed in the North Louisiana Refuges Complex.<br><br>In years of normal or above rainfall, the refuge's bottomland hardwood forest is a very important overflow area for the Ouachita River basin. High water levels, which usually occur between January and May, can flood up to 87% of the refuge. The wetland forests not only provide habitat to wetland dependent wildlife, but they also reduce damage from flooding in developed areas, they filter silt and other particles from the water, they help neutralize pollutants in the water, and they provide recharge areas for aquifers (natural underground water storage areas)."

          "The Egmont Key National Wildlife Refuge, was established in 1974 and protects a diverse community of animals and plants, many of which are either threatened or endangered. This island refuge was once the site of the former United States Army Fort Dade Military Reservation, and abundant reminders of this unique military past can be found scattered throughout the island today. Silent gun batteries testify to a time when mighty battleships reigned supreme on the world's oceans, and a brick carriage road meanders across the island recalling the days when mules and horses carried military personnel and their dependents on sunny picnics to the beaches. Today, gulls, least terns and other birds perch on the now silent batteries, while Gopher Tortoises, box turtles and an occasional tourist traverse the old carriage roads. Egmont key, an island that once quaked under the sound of massive coastal cannon fire, now resides quietly amid the sounds of wildlife as, once more, nature has taken over this little slice of Florida paradise."

ACE Basin stands for the Ashepoo, Combahee, and  Edisto Rivers, which form the estuary and parts of the Refuge boundary. The entire basin encompasses more than 350,000 acres, of which the Refuge comprises just less than 12,000 acres.<br><br>Part of the historical values of the ACE Basin were also protected. The refuge office, a former rice plantation house built in 1828, is one of only three antebellum mansions that survived the civil war in the ACE Basin area. Former owners ensured it would be preserved by placing it on the National Register of Historical Places. Undeveloped and unpolluted, the habitat remains diverse and extremely productive."

Historically, periodic flooding of the \"bottoms\" during winter and spring provided excellent wintering waterfowl habitat. These wetlands, in combination with the pine and upland hardwood forest on the higher ridges, support a wide diversity of native plants and animals."

Horizontal sections of the cave are known to be more than 15 miles long and vertical drops of 450 feet are found within. Spectacular features including unrivaled formations, important paleological and archaeological finds, and a diverse cave fauna have contributed to Fern Cave as being described as the most spectacular cave in the U.S. and has fame both nationally and internationally."

The refuge is located in the core of occupied panther territory, and protection of this important area was needed to ensure that not only panthers and their habitat were protected, but also important wildlife corridors that connected adjacent private and public lands.  In 1996, the refuge was expanded to 26,400 acres with the addition of more Collier family land through the Arizona-Florida Land Exchange Act of 1988.  Today, in addition to the 5-11 Florida panthers that den, hunt and roam the refuge each month, numerous other wildlife also call the refuge home, including black bears, bobcats, white-tailed deer, Big Cypress fox squirrels, alligators and wood storks."

The Refuge was named for the legendary African-American hunting guide who led President Theodore Roosevelt on his famous Mississippi bear hunting trip. When President Theodore Roosevelt, a passionate sportsman, traveled to Mississippi for a private bear hunt in 1902, Collier was tasked with planning almost every aspect of the adventure, including tracking and driving a bear to the President’s hunting blind to offer him a clear shot. However, the timing didn’t work out as planned, and President Roosevelt left the blind for lunch at the camp before Collier’s team could bring the bear into position. To protect his hunting team, Collier restrained the bear and tied it to a tree. When President Roosevelt arrived, he, like any hunter of honor, would not shoot the restrained animal. The event was publicized nationwide and resulted in the creation of the first stuffed toy bear called “Teddy’s bear.” President Roosevelt told Collier during the trip that he, &ldquo;…was the best guide and hunter he’d ever seen.&rdquo;",

          "Key West National Wildlife Refuge is among the first refuges established in the United States. President Theodore Roosevelt created the refuge in 1908 as a preserve and breeding ground for colonial nesting birds and other wildlife, during the period when widespread plume hunting was devastating bird populations throughout Florida. Key West NWR is west of Key West, Florida, and accessible only by boat. Key West NWR consists of the Marquesas Keys and 13 other keys distributed across over 375 square miles of open water.  The refuge encompasses 208,308 acres of land and water, with only 1 percent (2,019 acres) being land. Most islands are dominated by mangrove plant communities. Exceptions are the hardwood hammock in the Marquesas Keys and the beaches and dunes there and on Boca Grande and Woman Keys. All islands lack freshwater and native, terrestrial mammals are absent.<br><br>Key West NWR provides habitat and protection for federally listed species, including piping plover and roseate terns. The refuge harbors the largest wintering population of piping plovers and the largest colony of white-crowned pigeons in the Florida Keys. It is a haven for over 250 species of birds, including 10 wading bird species that nest in the refuge. Other notable imperiled species include the Miami blue butterfly and sea turtles. Waters within the refuge’s administrative boundaries are important developmental habitat for green, loggerhead, and hawksbill turtles. More loggerhead and green sea turtle nests are found each year in Key West NWR than any area of the Florida Keys except for the Dry Tortugas."

Topography on the refuge is characterized by ridges and swales that create a great diversity of plant and animal communities. The refuge is named for Lake Ophelia, a 350-acre permanently flooded lake / swale.  Major habitat types found on the refuge include: 8,400 acres bottomland forest, 4,200 acres reforestation and 3,400 acres cropland that are used to provide winter forage for migratory waterfowl, 500 acres of managed moist soil wetlands and 1,000 acres of lakes and bayous.",

John Mackie purchased it around 1768 and over the years the name was somehow changed to Mackay Island. Other previous owners include Thomas Dixon, author of &ldquo;The Klansmen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Birth of a Nation&rdquo; and Joseph P. Knapp, founder of &ldquo;More Game Birds In America&rdquo; which is now known as &ldquo;Ducks Unlimited&rdquo;. He built a private resort and experimented with various wildlife management techniques, some of which are still used today. After Knapps' death, Mackay Island passed through several owners until the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service recognized the value of the area as a refuge and acquired it in 1961."

          "Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge, administered as a satellite refuge of J.N. &ldquo;Ding&rdquo; Darling NWR, is located within the Matlacha Pass Charlotte Harbor estuary, Lee County, Florida, approximately 8 miles northwest of Fort Myers. On September 26, 1908, three small islands were established as a &ldquo;... preserve and breeding ground for native birds&rdquo; by President Theodore Roosevelt.<br><br>Since then, the refuge has grown to 23 islands encompassing about 512 acres. Designated by the State of Florida as an Aquatic Preserve, the refuge islands are part of a highly productive estuary which supports a diverse array of wildlife. The islands contain two basic vegetative zones, upland sand ridges and mangroves.<br><br>Fisherman Key, one of the largest islands of the refuge, once had fish camps and permanent residents on it. Several islands of the Matlacha Pass Refuge are used as roosting and nesting sites for a variety of wading and water birds. The beaches and shores provide loafing, feeding, and nesting areas for migratory ducks, shorebirds, gulls, and terns.<br><br>Ospreys, which are listed as a priority species in the Regional Resource Plan, can be observed nesting and feeding in Matlacha Pass area. Several endangered and threatened species benefit from the habitats described including: bald eagles, wood storks, sea turtles, and manatees."

Established in 1934, the 50,180-acre Refuge consists of open water, marsh, forest and croplands. The centerpiece of the Refuge is the shallow Lake Mattamuskeet. At 40,100 acres, it is North Carolina’s largest natural lake.<br><br>The Refuge’s strategic location along the Atlantic Flyway makes it a vitally important stopover for wintering waterfowl. Over the past 35 years, up to 80 percent of the Northern Pintail and up to 30 percent of Green-wing Teal that annually migrate along the Flyway utilize Mattamuskeet. In total, the Refuge attracts more than 200,000 ducks, geese and swans from November through February.<br><br>About 58,000 visitors use the Refuge annually to hunt, fish, and observe and photograph wildlife.",

          "Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge traces its beginnings to the development of the nation’s Space Program. In 1962, NASA acquired 140,000 acres of land, water, and marshes adjacent to Cape Canaveral to establish the John F. Kennedy Space Center. NASA built a launch complex and other space-related facilities, but development of most of the area was not necessary. In1963 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service signed an agreement to establish the refuge and in 1975 a second agreement established Canaveral National Seashore. Today, the Department of Interior manages most of the unused portions of the Kennedy Space Center as a National Wildlife Refuge and National Seashore."

The crane population, at that time only 30-35 birds, is currently at approximately 110 birds. Through captive rearing and reintroduction to the area as well as wild birds nesting in the savannas, the crane population continues to grow. <br><br>The refuge also protects and restores the last large expanses of wet pine savanna, primarily through the use of prescribed fire. The wet pine savanna is one of the most diverse ecosystems in the U.S. with more than 30 plants found in a square meter of land."

The 9,000-acre mountain refuge contains beautiful vistas and a rugged landscape of unfragmented forests.<br><br>The refuge is situated along the rugged landscape of Choccolocco Mountain, one of the highest mountain ridges in Alabama. High elevation vistas (2063 feet ASL) provide an array of beautiful fall colors and breathtaking views of the surrounding region. Hardwood forests along mountain ridges contain species typical of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the north, while slopes and lower elevations are covered by longleaf pine and hardwoods commonly associated with the Coastal Plain.<br><br>A hundred years of army wildfires have maintained healthy longleaf pine forests over much of the refuge. Without recurring fire, these same forests have disappeared from much of the surrounding region. The refuge provides a unique laboratory for studying and understanding the natural composition of fire maintained second and old-growth longleaf pine forests.",

The Swamp is one of the world’s largest intact freshwater ecosystems forming the headwaters of both the St. Marys and the Suwannee Rivers. Refuge habitats including the restoration of the surrounding upland longleaf pine forest provide for threatened and endangered species, such as red-cockaded woodpecker, wood storks, indigo snakes, and a wide variety of other wildlife species. It is world renowned for its amphibian populations that are bio-indicators of global health and more than 600 plant species have been identified on refuge lands.  Boasting over 350,000 acres of designated Wilderness, the refuge provides opportunities for visitors like nowhere else.  Visitors can paddle through 120 miles of water trails in the Okefenokee swamp encountering American alligator, barred owls and many other species of wildlife.  The refuge also provides visitors the opportunity to learn about the culture of the Okefenokee Swamp through the Chesser Island Homestead and other historical sites.  The Okefenokee NWR is a Wetland of International Importance (RAMSAR site) and on the US’s World Heritage tentative nomination list.",

          "Located in southeast Arkansas in Ashley County, Overflow National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1980 to protect one of the remaining bottomland hardwood forests considered vital for maintaining mallard, wood duck, and other waterfowl populations in the Mississippi Flyway. This 13,000 + acre wetland complex consists of seasonally flooded bottomland hardwood forests, impoundments, and croplands. During the winter, a 4,000 acre greentree reservoir is created when the bottomland hardwood forests are allowed to flood. This seasonally flooded area provides a haven for mallards, wood ducks, and other waterfowl species.<br><br>This refuge is a wetland complex within the watershed of Overflow Creek which flows southerly along the length of the refuge. On the west boundary, there are only about 100 acres of uplands found on a narrow strip along the escarpment that separates the Mississippi Alluvial Valley from the Gulf Coastal Plain. The majority of the refuge is bottomland hardwood forest consisting primarily of willow and overcup oaks. Willow oaks, found here in abundance, produce small acorns that are an excellent source of food for the mallards and wood ducks that make their winter home here.<br><br>Throughout the refuge are a number of impoundments, where the water and the plants are managed to benefit wildlife living on the refuge, especially waterfowl. These areas, called moist soil units, are very important in insuring that there is enough food for the birds that spend the winter here. Natural foods provide essential nutrients for birds to survive the winter and nest successfully in the spring. These moist soil units, along with the croplands, and bottomland hardwoods forest, provide a mix of habitats that support a variety of wildlife throughout the year."

          "Established in 1978, Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is noted for its large waterfowl population, resident game and its numerous sloughs and wetlands. Although limited archaeological evidence exists about the earliest inhabitants of the Lower Mississippi Delta, early Native Americans probably hunted, fished, and even farmed much of the area now included in the boundaries of Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. Unlike the more nomadic tribes of the northern and western plains, the Yazoo Indians built small villages and retreated into the loessal bluffs along present-day Yazoo City only when forced to by rising flood waters. Many raised “Indian Mounds” can be found still visible throughout the Delta.<br><br>Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge's expansive bottomland hardwood forests, cypress-tupelo sloughs, and meandering bayous represent some of the best remaining examples of the historically predominant habitat types that once characterized the entire Mississippi floodplain."

          "Pinckney Island NWR, established December 4, 1975, was once included in the plantation of Major General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a prominent lawyer active in South Carolina politics from 1801 to 1815. Few traces of the island's plantation in the 1800's exist today. From 1937 to 1975, when it was donated to the Fish and Wildlife Service, Pinckney Island was privately owned and managed as a game preserve.,br><br>The 4,053 acre refuge includes Pinckney Island, Corn Island, Big and Little Harry Islands, Buzzard Island and numerous small hammocks. Pinckney is the largest of the islands and the only one open to public use. Nearly 67% of the refuge consists of salt marsh and tidal creeks. A wide variety of land types are found on Pinckney Island alone: salt marsh, forestland, brushland, fallow field and freshwater ponds. In combination, these habitats support a diversity of bird and plant life. Wildlife commonly observed on Pinckney Island include waterfowl, shorebirds, wading birds, raptors, neo-tropical migrants, white-tailed deer and American alligators, with large concentrations of white ibis, herons, and egrets.<br><br>The refuge is located in Beaufort County, South Carolina and is 1/2 miles west of Hilton Head Island off of U.S. Highway 278. The island is bounded by Skull Creek (the Intracoastal Waterway) on the east, Mackay Creek on the west, and its northern tip faces Port Royal Sound. From I-95, take SC Exit 8 east towards Hilton Head Island approximately 16 miles to the entrance gate on the left."

          "Pine Island National Wildlife Refuge is located on the southwest coast of Florida, north of Sanibel Island in the Pine Island Sound. It is administered as part of the J.N. &ldquo;Ding&rdquo; Darling NWR. The refuge was established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908 to protect the thousands of herons, egrets, and pelicans that were being hunted to support the plume trade in the early 1900's. The refuge has also been designated as a Florida State Aquatic Preserve.<br><br>The 500-acre refuge has been expanded to over 17 islands and consists of densely forested red and black mangroves with little uplands habitat. Indian shell mounds located on Benedict Island show evidence of Calusa Indians once inhabiting the area at the time of European exploration. Several of the islands, including Hemp Island and Bird Key, are important nesting and roosting areas for colonial birds, particularly the Brown pelican. Raccoons are the primary mammal found on the islands and dolphins and manatees can be seen in the surrounding waters.<br><br>Small colonies of gopher tortoises may be found on some of the larger islands. Endangered and threatened species include bald eagles, wood storks, sea turtles, and manatees."

Behemoths like paddlefish, alligator gar, and lake sturgeon are cultured here for restoration projects. Striped bass are also produced and stocked as part of a large national restoration effort. National Wildlife Refuges are benefited by thousands of largemouth and bluegill produced and stocked by the hatchery. Private John Allen NFH raises a variety of fish specifically to host the parasitic stage of mussels as part of a multi-hatchery mussel conservation partnership."

          "Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is located in three counties (Noxubee, Oktibbeha, and Winston) and was created from lands obtained through the 1930s Resettlement Administration. Before Government ownership, the land area within the refuge was intensively farmed and over-grazed.  After years of proper land stewardship, the refuge is now an excellent example of forest and wildlife management.  The refuge provides needed habitat protection for the extremely valuable, rapidly disappearing bottomland hardwood forest communities.<br><br>The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker relies on the refuge for its existence in east-central Mississippi.  This population of woodpeckers is one of only four sites the species can be seen in the state.  In addition, many neotropical migratory bird species greatly benefit from the variety of habitats the refuge provides.  Four green-tree reservoirs (GTRs), two major lakes (Bluff Lake – 900 acres and Loakfoma Lake – 400 acres), 16 small impoundments, and assorted wetland areas provide important habitat for the wood stork, American alligator, bald eagle, and wintering waterfowl.<br><br>Over 150,000 visitors annually participate in activities including fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife photography, wildlife observation, environmental education, and research.  The refuge serves as an outdoor classroom for Mississippi State University and other local educational institutions. The National Audubon Society has designated Sam D. Hamilton Noxubee National Wildlife Refuge as an Important Bird Area (IBA), one of five of global importance in Mississippi.",

          "Savannah National Wildlife Refuge, established April 6, 1927, consists of 29,175 acres of freshwater marshes, tidal rivers and creeks, and bottomland hardwoods. Waterfowl are most abundant from November through February, while alligators and other reptiles are frequently seen from March through October. Birdwatching opportunities are good all year, but are best from October through April when temperatures are mild and many species of waterfowl and other wintering birds are present. Access to many areas is by boat only.",

          "Established on May 9, 1938, by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the refuge is an important resting and feeding area for migratory birds including gulls, terns, neotropical migratory songbirds, and shorebirds. During all seasons, the refuge's shoreline and open spoil deposits are used as resting sites for brown pelicans, gulls, and terns. Endangered species, including piping plovers and wood storks, have been observed on the refuge land, while shortnose sturgeon and manatees have been found in the waters bordering Tybee.

Although the Refuge is only about 24 acres of ponds, mixed pine-hardwood forest, and a residence, and contains Thomas Spring. A second pond was constructed on the Refuge in 1983 to provide additional darter habitat. The Refuge is unstaffed and administered by Mountain Longleaf NWR.<br><br>The watercress darter is a small, very colorful fish measuring up to 2.5 inches in length. The fish is currently found in only five sites in the upper Black Warrior River drainage near Birmingham, Alabama. They are found only at mid-depths in dense accumulations of aquatic vegetation including watercress, in springs and spring runs. Green sunfish, bluegills, and sculpins are known to prey on watercress darters. The darters feed on snails, crustaceans, and insect larvae that inhabit springs and spring runs."
